I recently took part in the AtliQ Sales and Forecasting Analysis project as part of the SQL course in Codebasics bootcamp. The project focused on building a framework to analyze sales data and generate actionable insights for optimizing AtliQ Hardware’s operations.

Key achievements in this project:

Yearly Sales Report: Developed a report for Croma India showing fiscal year and total gross sales.
Market Badge System: Implemented a stored procedure to assign markets as Gold (if total sold quantity > 5 million) or Silver.
Key KPIs: Generated detailed reports for the top 5 markets, top 5 products, and top 5 customers by net sales.
Top Customers Report: Created a bar chart report for FY 2021, showcasing the top 10 customers' global market share %.
Regional Sales Breakdown: Designed a pie chart to capture the net sales % breakdown by region (APAC, EU, LTAM).
Top Products by Division: Identified the top products in each division based on quantity sold.
Forecast Accuracy: Built a forecast accuracy report for all customers in a given fiscal year.
During the project, I utilized user-defined functions (UDFs) like get_fiscal_year and get_fiscal_quarter to automate calculations, streamlining data handling. Stored procedures such as get_market_badge, get_monthly_gross_sales_report_customer, get_forecast_accuracy, and others, helped encapsulate logic for complex data analysis tasks. Additionally, views such as Gross Sales View and Net Sales View were implemented to simplify data access and reporting.

This project highlighted the importance of leveraging SQL’s powerful tools, including functions, procedures, and views, to enhance data analysis and provide insightful, actionable business reports.
